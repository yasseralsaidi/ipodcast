Full-Stack Developer Assignment
Objective
The objective of this assignment is to test your ability to research and analyze problems in order to reach the best possible technical solution.

Technologies Used at Thmanyah for Project Development
We use many technologies to build our products. These technologies may differ from one project to another, but generally, the following is the common framework used in most of our projects:

We use JavaScript as the programming language, with an emphasis on using TypeScript to ensure output quality and reduce errors during the development process.

We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud platform to run our software.

We use Fastify or Nest.js as backend frameworks to build systems.

We use either SQL (Postgres) or NoSQL (DynamoDB) as our database.

For frontend development, we use:

Next.js as the framework for building interfaces.

Tailwind CSS for styling.

The Assignment
The final deliverable of this assignment is to build a REST API endpoint that accepts a search keyword as a request parameter, uses the iTunes Search API to fetch results, stores the results in a database, and then returns the result as a response.

So we want you to implement only the essential requirement, which is:

Fetching data from the iTunes Search API.

Storing the results in the database.

Returning the results as a response.

Then, build a web page to display the search results using frontend technologies, similar to the following example page:
üîó https://podbay.fm/search?q=%D9%81%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86

What You Are Expected to Deliver
We prefer that you solve the problem using the same technologies we use at Thmanyah. However, if you haven‚Äôt used them before and face difficulty in applying the solution with them, that‚Äôs totally fine ‚Äî you may implement the solution using whichever framework you find suitable.

Task Requirements:
Build a REST API using the framework of your choice from the ones mentioned above.

The endpoint should accept a search keyword as input and search using the iTunes Search API (e.g., for the podcast ‚ÄúFunjan‚Äù).

Store the resulting list of shows in a database.

Return the list of shows you stored in the response.

Build a page to display the results using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Lastly
After completing your solution in the way you find appropriate, we would like you to write a brief document explaining:

How you approached solving the problem.

The main challenges you faced.

Any suggestions or ideas you have for solving the problem differently or in a better way.
